This is my Python game project built with pygame.</br> Alien Invasion is a classic 2D arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame. </br>
Players control a spaceship, aiming to shoot down an alien fleet before it reaches the Earth. Each level presents increasing challenges with faster and more aliens,
testing players' reflexes and aiming skills.</br>The entire game is inspired and made with the help of python crash course book.
